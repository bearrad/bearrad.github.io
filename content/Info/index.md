I spend lots of time meditating, and as an occasional writer, I have to introduce myself to others, so I made an introduction board:<br>
🥖Best favorite Swimming and Cycling <br>
🍞Best at Unlimited fantasy and Lying on the sofa<br>
🍩Best love Sleep more while young<br>
🥯Best interesting Work all day, but happy my time in night <br>
Breathing exercises are the foundation of meditation. <br>
Deep focused breathing helps get oxygen into your blood and can change your emotional state.<br>
